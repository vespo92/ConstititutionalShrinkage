# New Government Structure - Git-Style Decentralized Governance

## Core Philosophy

**Government as Code**: Treat laws and governance like software development
- Laws are code stored in version control
- Citizens are developers who can fork and propose changes
- Voting is merge approval
- Regions are different deployment environments
- Constitution is the main branch with protected status

## Constitutional Layer (The Main Branch)

### Immutable Core (Protected Branch)
- Bill of Rights 2.0 - cannot be overridden
- Individual sovereignty
- Property rights
- Anti-coercion principles
- Conflict resolution hierarchy

### Amendment Process
- Fork the constitution
- Propose changes as pull requests
- 75% supermajority to merge
- 2-year review period
- Regional opt-in for contested amendments

## Regional Pod System

### Pod Structure (Replaces Federal-State-Local)

**Tier 1: Local Pods (10,000-100,000 people)**
- Neighborhood/town level
- Direct democracy for most decisions
- Manage local services (police, fire, roads, schools)
- High autonomy within constitutional bounds

**Tier 2: Regional Pods (100,000-5,000,000 people)**
- City/county/multi-county level
- Representative democracy or liquid democracy
- Coordinate inter-local issues
- Regional infrastructure
- Regional courts

**Tier 3: Super-Regional Pods (5M-50M people)**
- Multi-state regions or cultural zones
- Interstate commerce coordination
- Major infrastructure projects
- Appellate courts
- Emergency coordination

**Tier 4: Federal Coordination (350M people)**
- Minimal federal layer
- Interstate dispute resolution
- National defense coordination
- Constitutional maintenance
- International relations
- Currency and trade standards

### Pod Characteristics
- **Flexible Boundaries**: Pods can merge, split, or reorganize based on community needs
- **Multi-Pod Citizenship**: Citizens can belong to multiple pods (residential, professional, cultural)
- **Opt-In/Opt-Out**: Voluntary participation in optional programs
- **Competition**: Pods compete on outcomes, citizens vote with their feet

## Legislative System (Git-Style Lawmaking)

### Repository Structure
```
constitutional-law/
├── main (protected - requires 75% approval)
├── federal/
│   ├── commerce/
│   ├── defense/
│   └── currency/
├── regional/
│   ├── northeast/
│   ├── midwest/
│   ├── south/
│   └── west/
└── local/
    ├── pod-{id}/
    └── ...
```

### Legislative Workflow
1. **Propose**: Any citizen can create a bill branch
2. **Discuss**: Open discussion on the proposal (like GitHub issues)
3. **Review**: Subject matter experts and citizens review
4. **Amend**: Changes via commits to the bill branch
5. **Vote**: Merge approval voting
6. **Merge**: Bill becomes law when approved
7. **Deploy**: Law takes effect in specified regions
8. **Monitor**: Track performance metrics
9. **Sunset**: Automatic expiration unless extended

### Bill Types
- **Local Bills**: Affect single pod only
- **Regional Bills**: Affect regional pod and children
- **Federal Bills**: Affect all pods (requires higher threshold)
- **Constitutional Amendments**: Modify the main branch
- **Emergency Bills**: Fast-track process with sunset

### Automatic Features
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically identify conflicts with existing laws
- **Impact Analysis**: AI-powered prediction of triple bottom line effects
- **Similar Bill Detection**: "This bill is similar to existing proposals"
- **Sunset Clauses**: All laws expire (1-10 years) unless renewed
- **Performance Triggers**: Auto-modification based on metrics

## Executive Functions (Distributed Execution)

### Regional Coordinators
- Elected or appointed per region
- Execute laws within jurisdiction
- Coordinate with adjacent regions
- Emergency response authority
- No single "president"

### Federal Coordination Council
- 9 rotating members from super-regions
- 2-year terms, staggered
- Coordinate defense, currency, treaties
- No veto power
- Transparent operations

### Agency Structure (Drastically Reduced)
**Consolidated Federal Agencies (10 instead of 100+)**:
1. **Defense & Security** (DoD, Homeland Security merged)
2. **Interstate Commerce** (regulates cross-pod trade)
3. **Currency & Finance** (Treasury, Fed merged)
4. **International Relations** (State Department streamlined)
5. **Constitutional Court** (Supreme Court + constitutional matters)
6. **Environmental Standards** (EPA minimized to interstate issues)
7. **Justice Coordination** (FBI for interstate crime only)
8. **Infrastructure Coordination** (major projects crossing regions)
9. **Emergency Response** (FEMA, disaster coordination)
10. **Technology & Standards** (weights, measures, internet, spectrum)

**Everything Else**: Pushed to regional/local pods

### Performance-Based Funding
- Agencies funded based on outcomes
- Public dashboards showing effectiveness
- Automatic budget cuts for poor performance
- Citizens can defund via voting

## Judicial System (Smart Courts)

### Court Structure
**Local Pods**:
- Community courts
- Restorative justice focus
- Peer juries
- Mediation-first approach

**Regional Pods**:
- Trial courts
- Specialized courts (tech, environmental, commercial)
- AI-assisted ruling suggestions
- Fast-track simple cases

**Super-Regional**:
- Appellate courts
- Interstate conflict resolution
- Precedent harmonization

**Federal**:
- Constitutional Court only
- 9 judges, 10-year terms (no lifetime appointments)
- Handles constitutional questions and inter-region disputes

### Smart Contract Law
- Simple contracts enforced by code
- Automatic execution
- Blockchain-verified
- Dispute resolution only when contracts fail

### Decriminalization Framework
**No Longer Crimes**:
- Drug possession (treatment instead)
- Victimless offenses
- Poverty-related offenses (loitering, panhandling)
- Over-regulation violations (need license to cut hair?)

**Remaining Crimes**:
- Harm to persons (violence, fraud, theft)
- Property damage
- Environmental damage
- Rights violations

### Restorative Justice
- Focus on restitution, not punishment
- Community service over incarceration
- Mental health and addiction treatment
- Reserve prisons for violent offenders only

## Citizen Participation (Direct Democracy)

### Citizen Portal (GitHub for Government)
Every citizen has account to:
- Propose bills
- Review pending legislation
- Vote directly or delegate
- Track representatives
- View all government data
- Report issues with laws

### Liquid Democracy
- Default: Direct vote on everything
- Optional: Delegate to experts by domain
- Revocable: Take back delegation anytime
- Transparent: See delegation chains
- Flexible: Delegate different topics to different people

### Voting Rights
- All citizens 16+ can vote
- Weighted voting (optional by category):
  - Reputation-based (earned through participation)
  - Expertise-based (credential verification)
  - Stake-based (for economic decisions)
  - One-person-one-vote (baseline for rights issues)

### Transparency
- All votes public (with privacy option)
- All government spending visible
- All contracts and agreements public
- All meetings livestreamed
- All data available via API

## Supply Chain Integration

### Exponential Distance Tax
Built into governance:
- Local production incentivized
- Regional self-sufficiency goal
- Environmental costs internalized
- Resilience over efficiency

### Regional Economies
- Pods encouraged to develop local industries
- Trade between pods is free (no interstate tariffs)
- International trade taxed progressively by distance
- Carbon border adjustments

## Triple Bottom Line Integration

### Every Decision Measured
- People impact (social wellbeing)
- Planet impact (environmental health)
- Profit impact (economic prosperity)
- Composite score must meet minimums
- Public dashboards for all metrics

### Performance-Based Governance
- Laws auto-sunset if metrics fail
- A/B testing across regions
- Best practices auto-propagate
- Failed experiments quickly terminated

## Migration Path from Current System

See `/docs/roadmap/2030-transition-plan.md` for complete timeline.

**Key Principles**:
1. Gradual transition (2025-2030)
2. Opt-in regions go first
3. Prove success before scaling
4. Parallel systems during transition
5. No forcing - convince with results
