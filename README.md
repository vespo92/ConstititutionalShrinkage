# Constitutional Shrinkage

**A Git-Style Decentralized Government Implementation**

> Reimagining American governance for 2030: replacing the outdated Congress model with a modern, efficient, transparent, and citizen-controlled system.

---

## Vision

The entire point is to get rid of the current American Government system as it stands to create decentralized Government pockets to accommodate their regional biases.

At the same token, it is a way to create a "Triple Bottom Line" themed government and to reduce the overall "crime" by reducing what crime is defined by.

**Core Principles**:
- **Smaller Government**: Reduce bloat, eliminate redundancy, minimize federal overreach
- **Less NGOs**: Direct citizen governance reduces need for intermediaries
- **Regional Focus**: Tight supply chains that heavily favor regional basis and tax higher supply chain costs at exponential rates
- **Variable Rules**: A Ferrari and a school bus shouldn't have the same speed limits - we need more variability based on context (least common denominator approach)
- **Decriminalization**: Reduce what constitutes crime, focus on harm prevention
- **Direct Democracy**: Citizens vote directly, not through disconnected representatives
- **Performance-Based**: Measure outcomes, sunset failed policies
- **Transparent**: All data public, all votes visible, all spending tracked

---

## What We're Building

A **turborepo monorepo** containing a complete reimagining of American governance using modern software development paradigms:

### 📱 Applications (`/apps`)

1. **[Legislative System](./apps/legislative)** - Git-style lawmaking
   - Bills as branches, voting as merge approval
   - Fork laws, propose amendments via pull requests
   - Automatic conflict detection with existing laws
   - Sunset clauses for all legislation

2. **[Executive Functions](./apps/executive)** - Distributed execution
   - Regional coordinators replace single president
   - Streamlined agencies (10 instead of 100+)
   - Performance-based funding
   - Complete transparency

3. **[Judicial System](./apps/judicial)** - Smart courts & decriminalization
   - AI-assisted rulings for consistency
   - Restorative justice over punishment
   - Decriminalize victimless offenses
   - Smart contract enforcement

4. **[Citizen Portal](./apps/citizen-portal)** - GitHub for government
   - Propose bills directly
   - Vote on everything or delegate
   - Track legislation in real-time
   - Transparent government data

5. **[Regional Governance](./apps/regional-governance)** - Decentralized pods
   - Self-organizing regional communities
   - Local autonomy within constitutional bounds
   - Competition drives innovation
   - Citizens vote with their feet

6. **[Supply Chain Management](./apps/supply-chain)** - Regional economics
   - Exponential distance taxation
   - Incentivize local production
   - True cost accounting
   - Environmental impact tracking

### 📦 Shared Packages (`/packages`)

1. **[Constitutional Framework](./packages/constitutional-framework)** - Immutable core rights
2. **[Governance Utilities](./packages/governance-utils)** - Shared governance functions
3. **[Voting System](./packages/voting-system)** - Secure, transparent voting with liquid democracy
4. **[Metrics](./packages/metrics)** - Triple bottom line tracking (People, Planet, Profit)
5. **[Business Transparency](./packages/business-transparency)** - Replaces EEO with radical transparency
   - Employment lifecycle tracking (every hire/fire decision public)
   - Complete supply chain transparency (raw materials to consumer)
   - Progressive tax system (up to 85% for billionaires)

### 📚 Documentation (`/docs`)

## Why This Matters

The current US government system:
- ❌ Takes **18+ months** to pass simple legislation
- ❌ Wastes **hundreds of billions** on bureaucracy
- ❌ Has **partisan gridlock** preventing progress
- ❌ Features **disconnected representatives** who don't serve constituents
- ❌ Enables **money to control** outcomes via lobbying
- ❌ **Over-criminalizes** everything, leading to mass incarceration
- ❌ Applies **one-size-fits-all** rules to diverse regions
- ❌ Has **zero accountability** - bad laws stay forever
- ❌ Operates in **secrecy** with hidden dealings
- ❌ Built for **1787**, not 2025

### Our System
- ✅ **30 days or less** to pass legislation
- ✅ **40% cost reduction** through efficiency
- ✅ **Transparent voting** eliminates gridlock
- ✅ **Direct democracy** - your vote actually matters
- ✅ **Public data** - all votes and spending visible
- ✅ **75% reduction** in incarceration via decriminalization
- ✅ **Regional autonomy** - local control for local issues
- ✅ **Automatic sunsets** - laws expire unless proven effective
- ✅ **Complete transparency** - everything is public
- ✅ **Modern and fast** - built for the 21st century

## The Git-Style Government Model

### Legislation as Code
- **Main Branch**: The Constitution (protected, requires supermajority to modify)
- **Feature Branches**: Proposed bills
- **Pull Requests**: Bill proposals with full diffs
- **Merge Approval**: Voting to pass laws
- **Version Control**: Complete legislative history
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically find contradictions
- **Rollback**: Revert failed policies

### Direct Democracy via GitHub-Style Interface
- Any citizen can propose a bill
- Public review and discussion
- Transparent voting
- Real-time tracking
- Impact analysis before voting
- Performance metrics after implementation

### Regional Pods (Decentralized Governance)
- Self-organizing communities
- Local autonomy with constitutional guardrails
- Competition between regions drives innovation
- Citizens can move between pods
- Best practices emerge organically

### Triple Bottom Line Metrics
Every decision measured on:
1. **People**: Social wellbeing, happiness, equality
2. **Planet**: Environmental sustainability, carbon, ecosystems
3. **Profit**: Economic prosperity, jobs, wealth

Policies must score well on all three or sunset automatically.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this realistic?**
A: Yes. Estonia has digital governance. Switzerland has direct democracy. We're combining proven approaches with modern technology.

**Q: Won't this cause chaos?**
A: No. Gradual 5-year transition with pilots proving success first. Parallel systems during transition.

**Q: What about people without internet?**
A: Public terminals, libraries, community centers. Same as voting now but better access.

**Q: Can this be corrupted?**
A: Less than current system. Blockchain voting, open source code, transparent operations, and cryptographic verification make manipulation much harder.

**Q: What about national defense?**
A: Federal coordination maintained for defense, just with less bloat and more accountability.

**Q: Will politicians support this?**
A: Some will, most won't. That's why we build grassroots support first and prove it works.

**Q: How is this funded?**
A: Crowdfunding initially, then government grants, ultimately saves money so pays for itself.

**Q: What if it fails?**
A: Pilots are small enough to fail safely. Learn, iterate, try again. Success in one city proves concept.
