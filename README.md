# ConstititutionalShrinkage


The entire point it to get rid of the current American Government system as it stands to create decentralized Government pockets to accomodate their regional biases.

At the same token, it is a way to create a "Triple Bottom Line" themed government and to reduce the overall "crime" by reducing what crime is defined by.

Smaller Government, less NGO's, tighter supply chains that heavily favor regional basis and tax higher supply chain costs at exponential rates.

Also makes it least common denomintaor based. A ferrari and a school bus shouldn't have the same speed limits, we mneed more variability.
