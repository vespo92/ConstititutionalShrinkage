# Transition Strategy: From Old to New Government

## Guiding Principles

1. **Gradual, Not Sudden**: 5-year transition (2025-2030), not overnight revolution
2. **Prove It Works**: Start with pilots, scale based on success
3. **Voluntary Opt-In**: Convince with results, not force
4. **Parallel Systems**: Run both systems during transition for safety
5. **Respect History**: Honor the old system while building the new
6. **Protect People**: Generous support for displaced workers
7. **Maintain Stability**: No disruption to essential services
8. **Constitutional**: Work within existing legal framework initially

## Phase-by-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Program (2025)

**Approach**: Limited scope, volunteer regions

**Selecting Pilot Regions**:
- Look for politically diverse set (avoid appearance of partisan)
- Mix of urban and rural
- Different economic conditions
- Enthusiastic local leadership
- Existing civic engagement culture

**Parallel Operation**:
- New system runs alongside traditional government
- Traditional system remains official
- New system initially advisory only
- Compare outcomes

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Small scale limits damage if failure
- Easy to shut down if not working
- Learn and iterate quickly
- Build proof points

### Phase 2: State-Level Adoption (2026)

**Approach**: Full state transitions

**State Selection Criteria**:
- Pilot cities showed success
- Strong public support (>60% approval)
- State legislature passes enabling legislation
- Governor committed to transition
- Constitutional compatibility

**State Transition Process**:

**Month 1-3: Preparation**
- Train state workers
- Migrate laws to git repositories
- Set up citizen accounts
- Public education campaign
- Test infrastructure

**Month 4-6: Soft Launch**
- New system optional, traditional remains
- Citizens can vote via either system
- Legislature operates in hybrid mode
- Monitor closely

**Month 7-9: Primary Operation**
- New system becomes primary
- Traditional system remains backup
- Most citizens using new system
- Most bills via git workflow

**Month 10-12: Full Transition**

- Smart contract law rolled out
- Decriminalization executed
- Prison population reduction

## Handling Specific Challenges
