# Current US Government Structure - Complete Mapping

## Executive Branch

### The Presidency
- **Structure**: Single executive (President + VP)
- **Term**: 4 years, max 2 terms
- **Powers**: Commander-in-chief, appointments, veto, executive orders
- **Problems**:
  - Too much power concentrated in one person
  - Partisan gridlock
  - Limited accountability between elections
  - Imperial presidency syndrome

### Federal Agencies (Executive Departments)
1. **State Department** - Foreign affairs
2. **Treasury** - Finance, taxes, currency
3. **Defense** - Military operations
4. **Justice** - Law enforcement, legal affairs
5. **Interior** - Land management, natural resources
6. **Agriculture** - Farming, food safety, rural development
7. **Commerce** - Business, trade, economic development
8. **Labor** - Worker protections, employment
9. **Health & Human Services** - Healthcare, social services
10. **Housing & Urban Development** - Housing policy
11. **Transportation** - Infrastructure, transit
12. **Energy** - Energy policy, nuclear security
13. **Education** - Education policy, student loans

15. **Homeland Security** - Border, disaster response, cybersecurity

### Independent Agencies (100+)
- EPA, NASA, CIA, FBI, NSA, SEC, FCC, FDA, etc.
- **Problem**: Overlapping jurisdictions, bureaucratic bloat

## Legislative Branch

### Congress Structure
**Senate**:
- 100 members (2 per state)
- 6-year terms (1/3 elected every 2 years)
- Confirms appointments, ratifies treaties

**House of Representatives**:
- 435 members (proportional to state population)
- 2-year terms
- Initiates revenue bills

### Committee System
- 20+ Standing Committees per chamber
- Subcommittees for specialized topics
- **Problem**: Committee chairs have too much power, bottleneck legislation

### Legislative Process
1. Bill introduced
2. Committee review (where most bills die)
3. Floor debate and amendments
4. Vote in one chamber
5. Repeat in other chamber
6. Conference committee reconciles differences
7. Presidential signature or veto
8. Veto override requires 2/3 majority

### Problems with Current System
- **Glacially slow**: Takes years to pass simple legislation
- **Gridlock**: Partisan divide prevents cooperation
- **Lobbyist influence**: Money controls outcomes
- **Representative disconnect**: Politicians don't represent constituents
- **Omnibus bills**: 1000+ page bills no one reads
- **Rider abuse**: Unrelated provisions snuck into bills
- **No sunset clauses**: Bad laws stay forever
- **No performance metrics**: Laws never evaluated for effectiveness

## Judicial Branch

### Federal Court System
**Supreme Court**:
- 9 justices (lifetime appointments)
- Final arbiter of constitutional questions
- **Problem**: Too politicized, too slow, lifetime appointments create stagnation

**Circuit Courts**:
- 13 circuits (12 regional + 1 federal)
- 179 authorized judgeships
- Hears appeals from district courts

**District Courts**:
- 94 districts
- 677 authorized judgeships
- Original jurisdiction for federal cases

### Problems
- **Backlog**: Cases take years to resolve
- **Inconsistent rulings**: Different circuits create legal uncertainty
- **Overcriminalization**: Too many victimless crimes
- **Mass incarceration**: Highest incarceration rate in the world
- **Unequal access**: Justice depends on wealth
- **Qualified immunity**: Police and officials shielded from accountability

## State & Local Governments

### State Structure (50 variations)
- Governor (executive)
- State legislature (bicameral in 49 states)
- State courts
- State agencies mirror federal structure

### Local Governments
- Counties (3,000+)
- Municipalities (19,000+)
- Townships (16,000+)
- Special districts (38,000+)

### Problems
- **Overlapping jurisdictions**: Multiple layers of government doing same things
- **Unfunded mandates**: Federal requirements without funding
- **One-size-fits-all**: Federal laws ignore regional differences
- **Limited autonomy**: States constrained by federal overreach

## Special Interest Influence

### Lobbying Industry
- $3.7 billion spent annually
- 11,000+ registered lobbyists
- Write legislation for compliant politicians

### Campaign Finance
- Citizens United unleashed unlimited spending
- Dark money hides donors
- Politicians spend 50%+ of time fundraising

### Revolving Door
- Politicians become lobbyists
- Industry executives become regulators
- Regulatory capture is the norm

## Summary of Systemic Problems

1. **Concentration of Power**: Too centralized, not responsive to regional needs
2. **Speed**: Designed for 1787, not 2025 - too slow for modern challenges
3. **Accountability**: No performance metrics, no automatic sunsets
4. **Complexity**: Regulatory burden crushes innovation
5. **Corruption**: Money controls outcomes
6. **Disconnect**: Representatives don't represent
7. **Overcriminalization**: Government criminalizes everything
8. **Bureaucracy**: 100+ agencies with overlapping missions
9. **Debt**: $34 trillion and growing - no fiscal responsibility
10. **Gridlock**: Nothing gets done due to partisan warfare
